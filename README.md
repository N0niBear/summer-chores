# summer-chores
Javascript chore checker

Overview - Callback Version

This project is a JavaScript exercise done through the Code:You course.
It demonstrates how to use callback functions to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
This program simulates a person completing their summer chores with the chance of getting tired and falling asleep before they finish.

Overview - Promise Version

This version of the project replaces callback functions with promises. 
Each chore is represented by a function that returns a promise.
If they "fall asleep", the promise is rejected with an error message. 
If it resolves successfully, it logs the result.
